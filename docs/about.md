*The Phishhiker's Guide* is such a classic that it's not even neccessary to use the full title any more. We faithful refer to it as *Phishhiker's* or *The Guide*. Sometimes all it takes is a thumb gesture in a library to have the entire phish-fi section collapse in fits of forbidden giggles.

Thanks for reading!
